      The California High School PC Club is an organization which aims to inform the students 
    of California High School of the different parts of computers and their impact in the world. 
    Throughout the club meetings, we will be discussing the functions of each computer part and 
    how each part corresponds. We will also discuss current innovations of technology in our 
    world and how it can impact us in positive ways. Our main goal in every club meeting is to educate and inform our school of how 
    computers can change lives and to get students excited about computers and their different functionalities. Computers 
    are the future and they will be a very important part of inspiring the world and making lives easier. We hope to inspire 
    students to build computers themselves by the end of the year. At the end of the school year, 
    we are hoping to have enough computer parts so that we will be able to build a computer and showcase it to the whole club.
